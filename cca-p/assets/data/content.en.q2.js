    "q": "A university runs separate agents for admissions guidance and student-record corrections, both with the same administrative tools. Guidance needs public information; record correction needs write access. Which configuration preserves both services while limiting each agent to its role?",
    "o": [
      "Log roles and actions at the shared entry point and review access daily",
      "Move both agents to a model with stronger role reasoning and use the shared catalog",
      "Require approval for guidance-agent writes within the shared tool catalog",
      "Assign role-specific tools and permissions for queries and record corrections"

    "q": "An operations assistant repeatedly picks the wrong diagnostic tool. Replays show several entry points querying the same source, with descriptions that omit input scope. Execution permissions already match the role. Which tool-configuration change should the team prioritize?",

      "Assign an agent to each tool and add a coordinator to route calls",
      "Upgrade to a model with stronger tool selection using the existing definitions",
      "Add tool examples and include the entire call history in each request",
      "Consolidate duplicate entry points and clarify their inputs and use cases"
    ],
    "e": "Duplicate entry points and unclear descriptions are observed causes. Clarifying the tool boundaries addresses them directly; replaying the same cases tests whether selection improves. See notes 3.1.",
    "w": {
      "0": "[Overengineering] No independent planning is needed. Extra agents add routing work while inheriting the ambiguous descriptions.",
      "1": "[Model substitution] The evidence points to ambiguous tools. Replacing the model without evaluation skips that cause.",

    "q": "An insurance claims agent must inspect cases and submit approved payouts. Its toolset also includes product pricing and account deletion. Reviewers require the payout workflow to remain available with controls before execution; logging already exists. Which changes meet those requirements together? Select 2.",
    "o": [
      "Remove unrelated tools and their execution permissions",
      "Retain pricing and deletion tools, with approval from the duty officer",
      "Centralize payout-log reviews and investigate anomalies under existing permissions",
      "Authorize each required payout and obtain owner approval for high-risk payments",
      "Make every tool read-only and hand payout submission back to staff"

    "q": "A hospital runs an unattended overnight job that reads an approved equipment catalog, with no patient data or signed-in user. The application may perform this job, but credentials must stay outside model context. Which approach fits?",

      "Use a restricted service account with credentials in protected startup configuration read by the model",
      "Keep privileged access and audit for patient-record reads after each run",
      "Use a restricted service account with credentials supplied by trusted execution"

      "Validate the MCP token audience and separately authorize downstream access",

    "w": {
      "0": "[Audit as prevention] Audit records replace neither audience validation nor the prohibition on passing incoming tokens through.",
      "2": "[Compliance shortcut] Compatibility does not justify waiving audience restrictions for the protected resource.",

      "Choose a model better at spotting malicious text and retain the execution path"

    "q": "A multi-tenant development platform enforces identity and resource authorization at tool execution. A disputed build-record read requires investigation, but logs contain only the agent reply and HTTP status.

      "Stream responses and measure first useful content separately from completion",
      "Route interactive requests to a faster, smaller model and accept releases by cost per call",
      "Submit course requests to Message Batches and deliver responses when ready"
    ],
    "e": "The immediate problem is that generated content remains invisible. Streaming addresses that wait. End-to-end completion still needs its own measurement; earlier visible output does not prove earlier task completion. See notes 3.3.",

      "2": "[Model substitution] A cheaper model has not been shown to preserve quality or improve the required user experience.",

      "Send standard API requests concurrently and assess descriptions completed per hour"
    ],
    "e": "The requests are independent and can wait, matching asynchronous Message Batches and its 50% discount. Most batches finish within one hour, but that is not a guarantee; requests unfinished after 24 hours must be handled. See notes 3.3.",

Repeated offline evaluations show that a lightweight model meets the quality target on simple cases with lower p95 latency and cost per success than the current model.

Which arrangements fit? Select 2.",

      "Break down HTTP success by tool and operation, increasing sampling during anomalous periods"
